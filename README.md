Run the Flask server:

    python server.py


The server will start at `http://localhost:5000`.

1. Enter the hashtag you want to scrape (e.g., `crimepatrol`).
2. Select the analysis type (`light` or `deep`).
3. Click the "Analyze Hashtag" button.

### Step 3: Scraping and Analysis

Once you submit the form:
