## 🚀 Features

- **Instagram Sentiment Analysis**
  - Scrapes hashtags, captions, and comments using Selenium.
  - Two implementations:  
    - **Transformer Model**: Classifies content as abusive/non-abusive.
    - **GenAI Model**: Provides detailed, descriptive sentiment using GPT (OpenAI).
  - Interactive web interface for real-time input and result display.

- **Reddit Sentiment Analysis**
  - Scrapes subreddit posts and comments using PRAW (Reddit API).
  - Uses generative AI (GPT) for sentiment summaries.
  - Web interface for subreddit input, mode selection, and result visualization.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository and navigate to the desired implementation folder.**

2. **Install dependencies:**
*(Each implementation may have its own requirements. Common: Flask, openai, praw, selenium, transformers, etc.)*

3. **Set up API keys:**
- Instagram: Update credentials in `hashtag_scraper.py`.
- Reddit: Add your Reddit API credentials in `reddit_scraper.py`.
- OpenAI: Add your API key in `server.py`.

4. **Run the backend server:**
    python server.py

5. **Open the frontend:**
- Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.

Flask backend for running scrapers, performing sentiment analysis, and serving the frontend.

- `index.html`, `script.js`  
Frontend files for user interaction and displaying results.

- `instagram_hashtag_posts.json` / `reddit_subreddit_posts.json`  
Intermediate data files storing scraped content.
